If you use proxies for your RED .R3D while editing you know creating them is slow. In Davinci Resolve, Premiere Pro or Adobe Media Encoder it takes time to load clips and configure it. 

With proxybeuker you only have to set the input and output folder and the tool does the rest. Great if you have 2500+ RED clips in multiple folders.

You need to have RedCine-X installed for it to work. The build is for OSX only at the moment. 

Build the source code yourself (code in .vscode - task.json) or download the zip from the dist folder.
