If you don't want to waste time setting up presets and slow workflows in Davinci Resolve, Premiere Pro or Adobe Media Encoder you can use this tool to quickly make proxies.

Standalone application for OSX. Easy to get going on Windows as well. 

You need to have RedCine-X installed for it to work. 

You can build the tool using pyinstaller.
pyinstaller --onefile -y --icon=ico.icns --windowed gui_rendertool.py
