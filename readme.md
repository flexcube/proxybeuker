ProxyBeuker helps speed up your video editing workflow if you edit RED files with proxies.
Creating proxies in Adobe Media Encoder and others takes time. You have to wait for all the files to be imported, set up folders, presets and all the other small tasks. 

This adds up if you have a lot of projects. Proxybeuker creates the proxies for you in only a couple of clicks.

Proxybeuker scans your import folder for all RED .R3D files and  starts converting them right away to FullHD ProRes LT files. It takes 3000 files as easily as 30. 

RED Cine-X needs to be installed for the software to work. 

Works on Mac OSX and Windows 10
